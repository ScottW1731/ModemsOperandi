### Prune the database of things like duplicate parts ###
#

#delete from parts where 1=1;  #dumb kill-switch (use only in dev!)
#delete from prefabs where 1=1;  #dumb kill-switch (use only in dev!)

# find duplicates:
select name, count(name) from parts group by name having count(name) > 1;

# replace duplicates, keep the lower id (because we autoincrement those):
delete t1 from parts t1 
inner join parts t2 
where t1.id > t2.id and t1.name = t2.name;
	
# Show that dups are all gone:	
select name, count(name) from parts group by name having count(name) > 1;

# Print the current contents:
select * from prefabs order by visited desc;
select p.name, p.cost, p.img_url, c.name from parts p 	
	join categories c on p.categoryId = c.id
	order by p.name;
